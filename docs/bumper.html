        <li>This kind of switch is known as a <em>microswitch</em>.</li>
        <li>The jump wires we are using are known as 'female' wires - these are slots, which connect with 'male' pointy wires, such as those on your robot.</li>
        <li>You can connect a switch directly to a micro:bit, instead of using your robot, by using crocodile clips. The robot is not required for the code below to work.</li>

    <h3>Programming</h3>

    <section id="code_step1">
      <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>testing your switch</p>
      <p>Open your robot program <a href="https://github.com/ScienceOxford/robocamp-2019-saved-files" target="_blank">(if you were at Robocamp, click here to find yours)</a></p>
      <p>You are going to add new code near the top of your program, underneath <code>import radio</code> and above <code>radio.config</code>.</p>
      <img src=".\images\add_code.png" alt="Position of new code, between 'import radio' and 'radio.config'" width="600px" height="auto">
      <p>In this spot, add the following code:</p>
      <pre><code>switch = pin12.read_digital()
display.show(switch)
sleep(1000)</code></pre>
      <p>Do you get a <code>0</code> showing on your screen?</p>
      <p>What do you see if you run the code for the first time while <strong>holding down the switch</strong>?</p>
      <p>Unplug your robot from the computer to make it easier to test - you can restart the code by turning it off and on again.</p>
      <p>You should get <code>0</code> when the switch is not pressed, and <code>1</code> when it <strong>is</strong> pressed. If not, check your code and your wiring.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="code_step2">
      <p><br><strong>Step 2: </strong>the logic of a bumper switch</p>
      <p>In this example, we are going to make your robot stop moving when the bumper switch is pressed, even if you continue to move your joystick.</p>
      <p>You can then improve this code by, for example, allowing you robot to move backwards to move away from the obstacle.</p>
      <p>Plug your micro:bit back into the computer, and remove the three new lines of code you added at the start of your program.</p>
      <p>At the bottom your program, in your <code>while True</code> loop, ask the micro:bit to check the status of it's switch, <strong>as well as</strong> doing everything else.</p>
      <pre>while True:
    switch = pin12.read_digital()  # this is your new line!!
    message = radio.receive()</pre>
      <p>The next part of your code tells the micro:bit to turn on the motors if the <code>message is not None</code>. Before doing this though, you want to check if the switch has been pushed or not!</p>
      <p>From your checks earlier, you know that switch is <code>1</code> if it has been pushed, so you can edit the code to look like this:</p>
      <pre>    if message is not None:
        message = message.split()
        if switch == 1:
            display.show(Image.NO)
        else:
            drive(int(message[0]), int(message[1]))</pre>
      <p>Now, if the switch is pressed, the robot will show an image instead of turning on the motors.</p>
      <p><strong>Test it out!</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section id="code_step3">
      <p><br><strong>Step 3: </strong>expanding this code</p>
      <p>Instead of stopping the robot completely, you can check if the joystick is trying to move it in a forwards or backwards direction.</p>
      <p>Some hints:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>int(message[0])</code> is the value being given to the left wheel.</li>
        <li><code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are valid commands in python.</li>
        <li><code>></code> means <em>greater than</em>, and <code><=</code> means <em>less than or equal to</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See if you can combine these things to make your robot behave how you want.</p>

    <section id="assembly">
      <p><br><strong>Step 4: </strong>fixing the switch to your robot</p>
      <p>Think about where your bumper needs to go, and what you want it to detect.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Should it go on the front or the side?</li>
        <li>Could you attach more than one bumper (you will need to write code for them both!)</li>
        <li>You can extend the reach of the switch by attaching things to it, for example lolly sticks.</li>
      </ul>
