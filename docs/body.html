    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p><strong><u>Step 1</u></strong> measure your robot</p>
    <p>Measure your robot's length, width and height, and write the measurements down.</p>
    <p>This is the <strong>minimum</strong> size you will need to design your body.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong><u>Step 2</u></strong> understanding nets</p>
    <p>A good way to design your first prototype is to design a <strong>net</strong>.</p>
    <p>A net is a flat (2D) shape which you can fold up to make a 3D shape.</p>
    <p>You can see an animation of a net turning into a 3D shape on the <a href="www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/net" target="_blank">Maths is Fun</a> website.</p>
    <p>If you are in a workshop with us, have a go with the Polydron shapes to see what kinds of designs you can make!</p>
    <img src=".\images\polydron.JPG" alt="Polydron pieces" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p><strong><u>Step 3</u></strong> creating your prototype</p>
    <p>To create a box that fits your robot, you need to think about all the sides, and connect them togther as a net.</p>
    <p>You do not want to enclose your robot inside a cube, as then the wheels won't be able to touch the ground!</p>
    <p>So to start with, try making a box with two open sides that your robot fits inside.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The top piece will be as <strong>wide</strong> and as <strong>long</strong> as your robot.</li>
      <li>The bottom piece is the same as the top piece.</li>
      <li>The back piece will be as <strong>wide</strong> and as <strong>high</strong> as your robot.</li>
      <li>The front piece will be the same as the back piece.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src=".\images\net-disconnected.png" alt="diagram of all of the pieces of the net, disconnected" width="600px" height="auto">
    <p>The one measurement all of these pieces have in common is the <strong>width</strong> of your robot, so you can connect them all together to make a net.</p>
    <img src=".\images\net-connected.png" alt="diagram of the net" width="600px" height="auto">
    <p>Create a net using your own robot's measurements on a piece of card.</p>
    <p>Cut around the outside, and <strong>score</strong> the inside lines to create a bend.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does it fit your robot?</li>
      <li>What <strong>adjustments</strong> do you need to make to allow your robot to drive freely?</li>
      <li>Do you need to make any <strong>cut-outs</strong>, such as to reach the charging port?</li>
      <li>How could you change the design to make a <strong>wedge shape</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Iterate</strong> your design until you are happy with it.</p>

  <div id="by-hand" class="left">
    <h3>If you are cutting the body by hand...</h3>
    <p>Get a piece of your chosen material large enough for your design.</p>
    <p>Check whether your material will allow you to score lines or not!</p>
    <p><strong>If it does</strong>, cut out the outside of your design, and score the inside lines. Then assemble around your robot.</p>
    <p><strong>If it does not</strong>, cut the outside <strong>and</strong> the inside lines, so all of the pieces are seperate. Then use tape to assemble around your robot.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="by-laser" class="left">
    <h3>If you are cutting the body on the laser cutter...</h3>
    <p>Get a piece of your chosen material large enough for your design.</p>
    <p>Use <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a> to recreate your design - paying attention to the measurements.</p>
    <p>If this is your first time designing for a laser cutter, have a look <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Designing-in-Tinkercad-for-a-Laser-Cutter/" target="_blank">at our instructions</a> first!</p>
    <p>When you have finished, you will have an <strong>.svg</strong> or <strong>.dxf</strong> file, which you can bring to us for laser cutting.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="by-cricut" class="left">
    <h3>If you are cutting the body on the cricut...</h3>
    <p>Get a piece of your chosen material large enough for your design.</p>
    <p>Use <a href="https://design.cricut.com" target="_blank">Design Space</a> to recreate your design from shapes - paying attention to the measurements.</p>
    <p>If this is your first time creating your own design on Design Space, talk to a workshop leader or check out <a href="https://learn.cricut.com/design-space-for-beginners" target="_blank">the Cricut tutorials</a> first!</p>
    <p>If you want to use score lines to fold your net, instead of cutting each piece seperately, you will need to add score lines to your design.</p>
    <p>After placing your score lines, click on all the pieces of your net <strong>except the score lines</strong> and <em>weld</em> them together.</p>
    <p>This will merge your shapes, making sure that the Cricut machine does not cut the inside lines.</p>
    <p>When you have finished, you will have a Design Space project, which you can bring to us to get cut on the Cricut.</p>
